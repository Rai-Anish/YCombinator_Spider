We provide construction companies with a single, AI-powered platform to manage their entire business operations. Our platform unifies project management, materials management, finance, estimating, and CRM—traditionally scattered across multiple systems—into one cohesive solution. For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. 

We reduce 

- Manual work by 60%
- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly
- Complete projects 3x faster. 

Why Now?
We're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.

🏃 Migrating Existing Spend

- When a credit card program onboards a new user, we make it dead simple for these users to switch their card-on-file at all of their top online merchants to their new card with one click.
- Our AI-powered browser extension not only automatically detects where our partners' users spend the most (Netflix, Amazon, T-mobile, Progressive), but also lets them switch out their primary payment instantly. Users press a button in their browser and their card-on-file everywhere instantly switches to their shiny new card (our partner's card!).

😌 Making Checkout Seamless

- Our fast checkout technology embeds “One Tap Checkout ” on the checkout page at over 50,000 e-commerce sites - making our partners' cards the easiest way for users to complete any transaction on their browser. 
- They can even customize the copy to tell the user why to use your card for that specific purchase. For example Chase could prompt their users to use their Sapphire Preferred card on Avis BECAUSE it offers car rental insurance.

🤑 Making Our Partners' Cards More Rewarding
- We partner with over 1000 of the country’s top merchants to offer additional affiliate-based cash back that our partners can tack on to their existing cash back. User can now earn double or even triple the cash back on Sephora when they user our partners' “One Tap Checkout” button instead of their other cards.",CardLift,"Mountain View, CA, USA",We help card issuers maximize their share of wallet.,Active,"fintech,payments,consumer-finance",2,https://withcardlift.com

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.

We are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:
1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?
2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?
3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?

Sage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.

No group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. 

We have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience.

Sam's ex-girlfriend introduced him to Greg back at CMU in 2017, and while that relationship didn't last, their friendship has. After undergrad, Greg went to Harvard Law School, while Sam worked for three years at Jane Street, building & leading a satellite dev team.

Greg graduated, Sam quit, and we founded Olive with a big idea: use AI to make the law more accessible. We started with AI in corporate law given Greg's background, but quickly realized the space was crowded, and turned our attention to the under-competed $65B personal injury market.

We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.


The Problem: 
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).


Our Approach: 
In our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",ReactWise,"San Francisco, CA, USA",AI Co-Pilot for Chemical Process Optimization,Active,,2,https://www.reactwise.com/

Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. 

Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can’t be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics.

While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. 

To change that, we’re creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners.

Our goal is to empower the best financial advisors (the independents!) to serve all Americans who want financial advice.  We are starting with growth, which is the most existential problem advisors face. 
                                                                                                                                                      
The organic growth process is highly inefficient and full of noise. Advisors often waste 60 hours of business development to convert 1 new client.  

At FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can:
- Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead
- Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair
- Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects

In essence, doing all the work for the advisors, and letting them focus on what actually matters, the client relationship.",FINNY AI,"New York, NY, USA",The OS for independent financial advisors ,Active,"fintech,machine-learning,finance,sales-enablement,automation",4,https://www.finnyai.com/

We met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, within which we built a $200m specialty finance business line. At Alt, we were faced with the manual workflows from compliance to servicing that are needed to make and manage consumer loans.

However, after the pain of hunting through regulatory codes, confusion of form filling, surprise of regulatory deadlines, monotony of PDF data extraction, anxiety of brittle excel spreadsheets, the frustration of buried email threads with advisors, and the missed phone calls with borrowers to chase payments … to name a few … we knew that this experience needed to be improved. 

So, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.

Finsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.

We are experts in LLMs, having scaled LLMs to 1000s of users in 2023. That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup.

The shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that. But, the open-source AI stack is a complete mess, with companies needing a team of engineers to set up 10+ different tools just to get started and every optimization needs countless engineering hours.

Pipeshift offers this stack out of the box.

• Profiles with Personality: OrgOrg profiles are as insightful as they are delightful. They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.
• Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on ""big rock"" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.
• Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.
• All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.
• Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of ""Software Engineer"" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.
• On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.

Our agents analyze sales calls, generate tailored collateral, and follow up until the deal is closed.

The founders met at UC Berkeley, and at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren’t just great at selling—they were elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies. 

However, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.

Mica’s agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer.

Sales collateral creation and follow-up is a $11b market in the US but this is just our beachhead. We’ll ship a fleet of agents that automate and eventually replace every other facet of the $80b enterprise sales market.

ESOPs are a federal retirement plan that enable businesses to give their employees a stake in the company in exchange for significant tax benefits. 

With 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing ""Silver Tsunami"" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.

By selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of — things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire — imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. 

Thousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth.
