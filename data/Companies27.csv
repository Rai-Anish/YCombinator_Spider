These reviews and votes can be cast from the site's iPhone app or from the service's homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.

The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a ""mob"", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too.

The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

Fitfu allows you to:

* Track your motion

Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.

* Celebrate progress with friends

Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)

*Lose what you want
