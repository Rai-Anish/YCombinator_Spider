In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems. 

We design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.

Today, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA. 

Our cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments.

That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don’t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

Goodcover is a Managing General Agent (MGA) that administers personal insurance on behalf of our Membership, a bit like how USAA does it.

Member's premiums are pooled and used to pay claims.  We take a fixed fee, and the remainder is returned in our Annual Member Dividend.

We work with multi-billion dollar capital partners to ensure regulations are followed, adequate claims capital is always available, and we have emergency capacity for catastrophes.

Technology allows us to eliminate waste, saving roughly 25% of the cost.  We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members.

As an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our ""Marketing Budget"" into savings for Members.  This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.
We do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.

Our granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:
    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor
    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)
    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)
    - added coverage for mold removal

Our MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, ""renting"" capacity as we need it.

All this adds up to our government approved pricing being 40-60% cheaper on average than that of our competitors. ",Goodcover,"San Francisco, CA, USA","Digital Co-op Renters Insurance = half the price, better coverage.",Active,"fintech,insurance",4,http://www.goodcover.com
