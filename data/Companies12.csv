As parents, we want to know more about our babies. But it’s hard to believe that, despite all the technology available, we still do not know our baby without a visit to the doctor or hospitals. Which is time consuming, expensive, and stressful.

That’s why we created Modoo. 

Mothers simply wear the device on their belly. It tracks baby’s heart rate, movements and generates baby’s health report, so we can consult a physician with just one click.

Modoo connects to an app that allows users to share data via social media sites like WeChat and Weibo, which makes it easy to help family and friends feel more connected.

And thanks to the information it collects, our users reported that, it has helped preventing the loss of 73 babies so far. 

We has been selling Modoo in China at price of 200 dollars since 2017. last year, we tripled our revenue to 3.4 million dollars. 

To target at a bigger market, we launched a subscription trial 3 months ago, with an initial price of 60 dollars. It’s growing 69% week on week, and already generating 50 thousand dollars in MRR. 

Pregnancy is a lucrative market. 16 million babies are born in China every year, that’s a $3.2 billion dollars home market. Worldwide 140 million births make a 28 billion dollars market.

About us, Jiliang is the no.1 employee in an AI startup backed by Google & Sequoia. Ying, the CTO has over 20 years experience in mobile tech with some of the world’s leading companies.

This has cultivated a fragile and lengthy supply chain, at odds with the nature of radioactive material.

This issue and its implications do not just effect molybdenum, but any other reactor-based isotope. Many promising cancer therapies are stuck in clinical trials, unable to secure enough material in a timely manner. Research doesn’t even happen because of the difficulty of sourcing any new isotopes.

It doesn't have to be this way. Atomic Alchemy is working to solve this by building the world's first scalable radioisotope production facility.

Our vision is to develop non-hormonal contraceptives to provide both women and men with birth control options that lack the associated risks of hormone-based options but are equally effective. Traditionally, it has been the women’s financial and health burden to have a contraceptive in place. Our first goal is therefore to  bring a novel non-hormonal, on-demand and low cost female contraceptive to the market that will substantially improve their quality of life and well-being. Our second goal is to develop the first ever non-surgical and highly effective non-hormonal contraceptive for men. Currently, male contraception is limited to two main options – vasectomy or condoms. Having such options available to both women and men will globally allow for much better family planning, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies including abortions and therefore reduce costs and ensure contraceptive health and well-being.",YourChoice Therapeutics,"Berkeley, CA, USA",YourChoice therapeutics is revolutionizing the contraceptive market…,Active,"health-tech,biotech",3,http://ychoicetx.com
