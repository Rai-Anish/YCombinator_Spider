Yuma is automating customer support by providing an AI Support Agent orchestration platform. Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.

We integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.

Top merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously.

## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?

There are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.

But they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.

Those merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.

## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:

Yuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.

These agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.

We believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.

Currently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.

We are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.

## Fun Fact

Yuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests.

Our goal is to simplify and enhance the operational side of deploying these models, making it easier for developers to monitor, manage, and optimize their AI applications at scale. Helicone provides a unified view of performance, cost, and user interaction metrics for various LLM providers, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and LangChain, empowering developers to make their LLM deployments more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective.

### Key Features

1. **Centralized Observability**: Our platform captures and visualizes detailed logs and metrics across all LLM deployments. With tools for prompt management, performance tracing, and debugging, Helicone provides real-time insights into the inner workings of your LLMs.

2. **LLM Performance Optimization**: Helicone supports prompt experimentation, success rate tracking, and fine-tuning, allowing you to continuously improve response quality and efficiency. This level of insight makes it easier to deliver high-performing, cost-effective AI applications.

3. **Flexible Data Management**: We understand that data privacy is critical. Helicone supports deployment options for dedicated instances, hybrid cloud integrations, or self-hosted environments, allowing clients to maintain control over their data and ensuring compliance with privacy standards.

### Built for Developers and Data Scientists

Helicone is designed to meet the needs of engineers and data scientists who require transparency and control over their LLMs. From chatbots to document processing systems, Helicone equips you with the insights needed to track costs, understand user interactions, and optimize outputs‚Äîall from one intuitive platform.

Sage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph.

We're fully open source, and provide a unique integrated development & observability experience for those building anything in the AI space. This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.

How? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.

We've got two open source projects:
- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).
- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev

Both Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.

The immune system usually doesn‚Äôt recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers.

Companies use Koala so that they don't have to hire dedicated infrastructure engineers.

Although 50-70% of organizations have already adopted Kubernetes, most developers agree that it is too complex and difficult to manage. It is intended to be extremely flexible in order to solve pretty much everyone‚Äôs needs, but it can take a ton of work and many auxiliary tools to get there.

As companies grow, they spend a lot on DevOps or Platform Engineers that try to reduce the burden on developers by gluing together all the 3p tools via custom internal tools.

We are building an ‚Äúinternal developer platform‚Äù out of the box, with best practices and golden paths for building and operating services on Kubernetes.

We do the research on the latest and greatest tools in the extremely vibrant ecosystem, and automatically integrate for you the tools you want to use.

We operate on our customers code and in your Cloud environment, so they never locked in and never restricted, as is common with classic PaaS offerings.

If you prefer a fully hosted environment like Heroku, Fly or Vercel, we‚Äôll host a cluster for you and offer you a one-click migration to your own cluster when you want.",Koala Ops,"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Tel Aviv District, Israel",A platform for developing microservices on Kubernetes,Active,"developer-tools,saas,b2b,kubernetes",3,https://koalaops.com/
