We talked to these humans, and learned that they spend 1/3 of their time just asking other humans for documents and data that are almost universally available online. While the market is slowly moving to transactional data, Lendsnap is the only company helping lenders get ahead of the competition by delivering original electronic documents and data sets. That means portfolios of our lender customers stay completely liquid in the secondary market. No one else can offer that today.

Lendsnap instantly gathers the original borrower documents and data for lenders by linking to consumer financial accounts. We increase loan origination team productivity by 25%+ and save applicants several hours on each application as well. Our intuitive and easy-to-use workflow makes it easy and safe for borrowers to turn in and for loan officers to receive the necessary documents for lenders to make a credit decision.
