About:

We are the best IDE with curated inventory of the best AI tools on the market (ie. Perplexity, aider, mem0, etc.), to make it easy for you to make what you want. Imagine if VSCode was reimagined with AI in mind since the beginning.

FAQ:

Why PearAI over competitors?
Over using vanilla LLM’s: 
Codebase Knowledge: PearAI has knowledge, or context, of your codebase achieved through RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and other integrated features that will make your AI coding experience seamless.
Over other extensions: 
No AI model vendor lock-in for higher quality code generation. We guarantee you we use the best model for your use case based on the most up-to-date leaderboards.
User Experience: As a complete IDE rather than just an extension, PearAI provides a more integrated and refined coding environment. This allows for smoother workflows and more intuitive interactions when coding with AI.
Over other AI Code Editors: 
Different: Competitors are approaching the huge task of coding with AI in a one-size-fits-all manner. Building for the future, PearAI has PearAI Inventory, which integrates the best tools for each part of the AI tech stack (chat assistant, code generation, search, collaboration, memory, etc.) into a unified, seamless user experience. Leading tools for each part changes rapidly, but individually beat each part of the monolith approach to coding with AI. With PearAI, we ensure you have the best-on-market experience of coding with AI at any given time. 
Last but not least: We are fully transparent and Open Source. Anyone can see, review, and contribute to our code! This allows for a community-driven product, mitigates privacy concerns that other similar tools face, and provides a faster development cycle thanks to our community. We want PearAI to be a culture. Read more: Why Open Source Matters for AI Code Editors.

Why PearAI?

You just want to be able to make what you want, fast. PearAI gets you that.
The AI tooling space is moving too quickly for most to keep up with. One day product X is best for code generation, the next day it’s product Y. PearAI aims to natively integrate the best-in-market AI tools for each aspect of coding with AI (tooling for code generation, LLM, search, codebase knowledge, debugging, etc.), so you can just focus on building as efficiently as possible.

What sets Sandra apart is its deep integration with dealership management systems, allowing it to manage even the most complex queries. This ensures no calls or leads are missed, boosting both customer satisfaction and team efficiency.

The car dealership industry handles over 3 billion calls annually, with each call averaging 4 to 6 minutes. Traditional call centers charge between $1 and $2 per minute, depending on the complexity of the service. Thus, we estimate the total addressable market for inbound calls alone to exceed $26 billion a year. This does not even account for future opportunities in outbound calls.

Before launching Sandra, the founding team spent years working in the automotive and call center industries during their time at McKinsey. The three co-founders graduated in Data Science and AI from institutions like MIT, Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris.

Codebuff is different from all the other coding agents, we swear!

Why it's cool:
- **It chooses files to read automatically on each message** — unlike Cursor’s composer feature. This saves you time and makes Codebuff respond more comprehensively.
- **It takes 0 clicks** — type your instructions and Codebuff will edit your files directly. It's simple and fast. Theoretically, you can do all your development by just chatting with it!
- **It has full access to your terminal** — Codebuff can run terminal commands to install packages, run tests, check for type errors, etc. Codebuff is an engineer working for you.",Codebuff,"San Francisco, CA, USA",Code with AI from our CLI,Active,"developer-tools,generative-ai,enterprise-software",2,https://codebuff.com

It brings all your training data together by integrating with top wearables and uses AI to make tracking weightlifting easy. This allows athletes to fully understand their training load, track holistic progress over time, and compete with friends in fresh, exciting ways.

Existing products tend to focus on only one type of exercise—either cardio or strength—leaving hybrid athletes juggling disconnected tools. As hybrid athletes themselves the founders found this frustrating and set out to build the unified approach they needed for their training.

Three of HYBRD’s founders previously worked at WHOOP, each leading teams across product, growth and analytics.
